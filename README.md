# The Dream Team

### Problem Statement
For our team project we decided that we wanted to do the 2022 State Farm Coding Competition.
The problem that we will be solving is we have 4 datasets that we will need to write methods that
will produce some output. We were provided a skeleton Java project with 10 JUnit Tests that must pass upon completion.
A bonus feature that is mentioned after getting the unit tests to pass are creating an interface
and/or an API to interact with the methods and display results graphically. We will most likely do this
as jsps and possibly through an API as well.
